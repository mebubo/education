This directory contains the library (*Reader.java files) for parsing
compiled Java .class files and an example program (Decompile.java)
which makes use of the library, as well as Makefile, this README file
and TODO list.

The big picture
===============



Details
=======

The main purpose of AttributeReader, ClassReader, FieldReader,
InterfaceReader, which inherit from the abstract class Reader, is to
implement methods readAll() and printAll(), specific to the layout of
the corresponding parts of the class file.

Decompile class has the main() method, which implements a small
program to print the contents of the .class file (it instanciates
ClassReader and uses its methods to read the class file and print the
info). 

Currently it outputs class name, access flags, superclass name, names
of the implemented interfaces, names of the fields of the class with
access flags, signatures of the methods (no exception info is
available yet). All in the form close to the standard Java syntax.

Usage
=====

To compile, issue

   $ make

The program can be run in the following way:

   $ java Decompile <class file>
